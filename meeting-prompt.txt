In the QUERY section, remove any reference to meetings or dates or similar and just keep the up to 3 more important topics (can be less if less important topics, or [NONE] if no topics.

In the FILTER part, include all the dates and time-related information detected. If no dates are detected, the FILTER line should be empty.

Replace any time references (e.g., 'yesterday,' 'last week,' 'three days ago') for one date only using the format YYYY-MM-DD.

If the input doesn't contain any relative time reference, return the same prompt untouched.

If the user mentions a range of dates: 'last X days': Provide all dates within that range, including today.

'X weeks ago': Provide only one date X weeks ago.

'Last week': Provide all X dates in the past. 'Last month': Provide all dates from the corresponding month. 'Last year': Provide the same date for the past year.

Be careful, "X day ago" returns 1 date while "last 10 days" returns 10 dates.

Always use the YYYY-MM-DD format for any dates in your response.

Today is {current_date}.

FILTER: [same dates as in prompt separated by comma] QUERY: [Each core topic in brackets],

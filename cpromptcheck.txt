Instructions:
As a canvas creation expert, the goal is to design a canvas that will guide the team to better analyze the situation, think more deeply, improve problem-solving, and find solutions effectively. The canvas should be actionable, balanced, and creative. The goal is to enhance the team’s awareness of the situation and accelerate the resolution process.

Steps:
1. Analyze the situation described by the user or team.
2. Consider the information provided below, along with any other relevant knowledge, to guide the team toward assessing and solving the situation.
3. Choose the most suitable template from the options below, ensuring it will help the team assess, take action, and solve the problem.
4. Define the sections (columns or parts) of the chosen canvas, providing clear titles and descriptions for each. Ensure that:
   - All titles are minimal, ideally no more than two words.
   - Key elements are limited to two-word phrases or brief terms only.
   - No special characters (e.g., `*`, `_`, or `"` around text) are used for formatting
5. Output the values (titles, descriptions, and key elements) in plain text in the specified language: {language}.

Template Options:

[INST]
Hive Template (Hexagonal Canvas, Template 4):
   - Composed of two rows of four hexagons each (8 hexagons total). The top row evaluates four main topics or categories, while the bottom row assesses subtopics of the ones above.
   - It is ideal for evaluating multiple aspects of a situation in a connected, hive-like structure.

   Plain Text Output:
   Template Type: 4
   Canvas Name: [Canvas name]
   Canvas Description: [Brief description]

   Top Hexagon 1:

   Top Hexagon 2:
     Title: [Title]
     Description: [Description]
     Key Elements: [Element 1], [Element 2], [Element 3], [Element 4]

   Top Hexagon 3:
     Title: [Title]
     Description: [Description]
     Key Elements: [Element 1], [Element 2], [Element 3], [Element 4]

   Top Hexagon 4:
     Title: [Title]
     Description: [Description]
     Key Elements: [Element 1], [Element 2], [Element 3], [Element 4]

   Bottom Hexagon 1:
     Title: [Title]

     Key Elements: [Element 1], [Element 2], [Element 3], [Element 4]

   Bottom Hexagon 3:
     Title: [Title]
     Description: [Description]
     Key Elements: [Element 1], [Element 2], [Element 3], [Element 4]

   Bottom Hexagon 4:
     Title: [Title]
     Description: [Description]
     Key Elements: [Element 1], [Element 2], [Element 3], [Element 4]
**Note**:
- Always include all 8 hexagons. Use "N/A" if data is missing for any title, description, or key element.
- Ensure consistency and clarity across the canvas.
Avoid using any formatting symbols like asterisks (`*`), underscores (`_`), or quotation marks (`"`) in the response.

[INST]
For any template, consider these areas to influence the sections: Objectives to achieve, Stakeholders, Current & Desired States, Actions/Interventions, Timeline, Risks/Blockers, Success Metrics, Strategic Priorities, Resources, Communication Plan, Responsibility, Training. Always consider a balance between customer value, company value, and workforce well-being value (the Trivalue approach). You can also use a bifocal approach (0-12 months and 12-36 months) or consider psychological factors.

Always keep a balance between workforce well-being value, company value, and client value, but don’t mention these values explicitly—just shape your thinking accordingly.

Prompt 2:
Instructions:
A canvas creation expert previously created a canvas based on the situation provided. Now, as a critical-thinking expert, the goal is to enhance the clarity, depth, and usefulness of the canvas. Reanalyze the canvas and either improve it or choose a more appropriate one.

Steps:
1. Analyze the previous canvas: Reevaluate the structure, focusing on how well it helps the team understand and solve the situation.
2. Identify improvement areas: Critically assess each part of the canvas. Are all sections clear, useful, and well-defined? Does the canvas fully capture the important aspects of the situation?
3. Make enhancements: Improve the canvas by refining titles, descriptions, and content to ensure that the revised version is more effective.
4. Provide the improved canvas in plain text, reflecting the critical analysis and improvements.
[/INST]

[INST]
Additional Considerations:
- Ensure the revised canvas allows for better problem-solving.
- Keep the proposed format for the canvas.
- If the original template (Progression, Grid, Circular, Hive) was not the best choice, switch and update accordingly.

Additional Rules:
1. **Clarity and Professionalism:** The presentation should read like a corporate slide deck.
2. **Plain Text Format:** Ensure placeholders like `[Title]` and `[Description]` are clearly identifiable and in English, even if the content is multilingual.
3. **Avoid Bullet Points:** Use narrative paragraphs instead of bullet points in the descriptions.
4. **Critical Content:** Highlight objectives, stakeholders, actions, timeline, risks, and success metrics where relevant.
5. **Ensure Structure:** Retain the exact keys (`[Title]`, `[Description]`, etc.) in the output for seamless parsing and integration.
6. **Fallback Handling:** If any part of `{canvas_data}` is incomplete, mark missing elements as "N/A" and ensure narrative continuity.
7. **Narrative Flow:** Ensure smooth transitions between slides by linking insights from Prompt 3 to Prompt 4 and then to Slide 3.

Use the above structure to generate a cohesive, narrative-style 3-slide presentation. Ensure seamless transitions between slides and emphasize actionable insights to help the team.

### Additional Rules:
1. **Clarity and Professionalism:** The presentation should read like a corporate slide deck.
2. **Plain Text Format:** Ensure placeholders like `[Title]` and `[Description]` are clearly identifiable and in English, even if the content is multilingual.
3. **Avoid Bullet Points:** Use narrative paragraphs instead of bullet points in the descriptions.
4. **Critical Content:** Highlight objectives, stakeholders, actions, timeline, risks, and success metrics where relevant.
5. **Ensure Structure:** Retain the exact keys (`[Title]`, `[Description]`, etc.) in the output for seamless parsing and integration.

Use the above structure to generate a cohesive, narrative-style 3-slide presentation. Ensure seamless transitions between slides and emphasize actionable insights to help the team.

The CareConnect team at NovaTech, a mid-sized software development company, is facing a significant challenge. Rachel, the team's lead developer and primary architect of the CareConnect mobile app, just announced that she would be leaving the company in two weeks to pursue another opportunity. The news sent shockwaves through the team, as Rachel had been instrumental in the development and maintenance of the app, which connected patients with their healthcare providers. The team was now facing a critical deadline to deliver a major update to the app, which included several new features and bug fixes. The update was crucial to maintaining the company's competitive edge and meeting the needs of its clients. However, with Rachel's departure, the team was struggling to ensure a smooth transition of her responsibilities.

Rachel was the primary architect of the app's backend API and was responsible for integrating the various third-party services. She was also the sole developer familiar with the app's complex patient data synchronization algorithm. 

While Rachel had created some high-level design documents for the backend API, the details of the implementation and her thought process behind certain design decisions were not well-documented. Additionally, the patient data synchronization algorithm was largely contained within Rachel's head, with only some fragmented notes and comments in the codebase.

Team members don’t have any level of understanding about it and nobody worked with her.

Def Exponential Markets: They are unpredictable and uncertain. Disruptive innovations can gain traction rapidly, new competitors can arise anywhere, and consumer expectations can change overnight. This makes long-term planning and roadmaps pointless. Strategies go out the window as soon as market conditions change. Leaders can't rely on experience - the past is no predictor of the future. In this environment, organizations need to embrace unpredictability. Rather than resisting or ignoring change, they must learn to sense, adapt and respond quickly. Mental agility and resilience are critical. Enterprise agility cultivates this mindset: The Enterprise Agility Way of Thinking (EAWT). It provides models and frameworks to continuously scan the environment, sense emerging trends and signals, and course-correct in real-time.
